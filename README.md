# Dungeons-Dragons
A first try to create a library to manage characters, and some dungeon master things ^^

[Quidelines to try to understand this repository]

first of all, everything here shall be written in snake_case, variables, functions, EVERYTHING unless classes, classes shall be named in CammelCase


its my first try doing this, so please be understanding of all the errors and re-doing and such things I'm going to do.

Next this will be programmed in python.

thats all for now! hope you all have fun trying to understand how to use this ^^
